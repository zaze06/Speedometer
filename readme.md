## Forge Support Transition
As of version 1.21 I chose to no longer support Forge in fevour of NeoForged


# This mod is a newer version of [speedometer-forge](https://github.com/zaze06/speedometer-forge)

## Changes from old forge version?
This was just a project I choose for trying the Architectury API for abstraction.
So changes are that now Architectury APi is required for this mod to work
